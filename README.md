# LeetCode Python Solutions 🐍

This repository contains **Python solutions** to over 200 LeetCode problems, covering a broad spectrum of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) topics.

Whether you're preparing for interviews, strengthening your problem-solving skills, or just enjoying algorithmic challenges, this collection serves as a clean, well-commented reference implemented entirely in **Python 3**.

Files are named in the format: `problem_id. Problem Title.py` (e.g., `1. Two Sum.py`), making it easy to locate solutions by LeetCode problem number.

## Features
- **Total Problems Solved**: 201+
- **Language**: Python 3 (100%)
- **Difficulty Levels**: Easy, Medium, Hard
- **Focus**: Readable, efficient solutions with explanatory comments
- Covers key topics: arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, sorting, searching, greedy, two pointers, sliding window, and more

## How to Use
1. Browse the file list on GitHub — files are naturally sorted by problem ID.
2. Click any `.py` file to view the full solution.
3. Run locally:
   ```bash
   python "123. Problem Title.py"
4. Copy the code directly into the LeetCode editor to test or submit.
Most solutions include comments explaining the approach, time complexity, and space complexity for better understanding.

## Contributing
Contributions are very welcome! You can:
- Adding solutions for unsolved problems
- Improving existing solutions (better performance, readability, or alternative approaches)
- Enhancing comments or adding explanations

**Guidelines**:
- Use the naming convention: `problem_id. Problem Title.py`
- Write clean Python 3 code
- Add meaningful comments (especially approach and complexity analysis)
- Ensure the solution passes all LeetCode test cases

Open a pull request — all contributions will be reviewed quickly!
